The Solar Incubator phase will kick off with an intensive face-to-face workshop for Mr. Nseya in Dubai, UAE, where he will work with Phanes Group\u2019s team and its incubator partners to set the foundations to deliver a bankable project. During that phase, Mr. Nseya will gain access to commercial and technical know-how covered by experts from project finance, project development and execution, legal, marketing and CSR, followed by further remote mentoring sessions in the succeeding months.<\/p><p class=\"\">\u201cMr. Nseya\u2019s project convinced the evaluation panel, not only with its strong CSR component but especially with his knowledge and commitment to the region where he hails from. He showed strong determination to bring his project to life in a challenging market environment. We believe this is where Phanes Group and its incubator partners can create the most positive impact, through the workshop and ongoing mentoring and knowledge sharing,\u201d Mrs. Haupts added. \u201cWe look forward to welcoming him to Dubai and want to encourage the other candidates to keep persevering in bringing their proposals to fruition, as everyone would have deserved to win.\u201d The goal of the Phanes Group Solar Incubator, held under the theme, \u201cYour Project, Our Expertise, For a Sustainable Future,\u201d is to provide access to commercial and technical knowledge, and eventually funding, to promising locally developed PV projects in sub-Saharan Africa, and to help entrepreneurs overcome obstacles that could prevent solar initiatives from reaching fruition.<\/p><p class=\"\">For more information regarding the Phanes Group Solar Incubator, please visit our webpage www.phanesgroup.com\/incubator<\/p><p class=\"\"><strong>More About Phanes Group <\/strong><\/p><p class=\"\">Phanes Group is an international solar energy developer, investment manager and asset manager, strategically headquartered in Dubai, UAE.
